## Code Level Metrics to Dashboards

{{< img src="tracing/profiling/profiling-metric-dashboard.gif" alt="Add profiling metrics to your dashboards.">}}

You can obtain key profiling metrics from services such as top CPU usage by method, top memory allocations by thread, and CPU usage by version to visualize in your dashboards and alert with monitors.
