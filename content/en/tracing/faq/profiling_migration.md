title: Preparing Your Beta Continuous Profiling for GA
kind: faq
---

**You must migrate your current setup as the agentless mode will no longer be supported when Continuous Profiling is generally available.**

As we get closer to Continuous Profiling general availability, we have made changes so onboarding your services is even easier than before. Notably, will now send profiles through the Datadog Agent, removing the need for an API key or an upload endpoint. In summary we made the following changes:

- Deprecated having to specify an API key: `DD_PROFILING_API_KEY`, `DD_API_KEY`, `DD_PROFILING_API_KEY_FILE`.
- Deprecated having to specify the uploading endpoint: `DD_SITE`.
- Added support to send profiles directly through the agent.
- Added support for including container-id header during profile collection so you can automatically get container tags.

## Migrating from Agentless to the Agent Setup

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Java" %}}

Perform following steps to migrate your service to send profiles directly through the agent:

1. Upgrade your agent to version [7.20.2][1]+ or [6.20.2][1]+

2. Upgrade the tracing library to [version 0.55][2]+ or run the following command to get the latest tracer version:

    ```shell
    wget -O dd-java-agent.jar 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.datadoghq&a=dd-java-agent&v=LATEST'
    ```

3. Clear `DD_PROFILING_API_KEY_FILE` or `DD_PROFILING_API_KEY` environment variable alongside the API key file as they were deprecated in version 0.55.

    ```shell
    unset DD_PROFILING_API_KEY_FILE

    # OR

    unset DD_PROFILING_API_KEY
    ```

    **Note** If you are using `-Ddd.profiling.api-key-file` flag, do not specify it during service invocation as it is also deprecated in version 0.55.

4. Ensure `Ddd.profiling.enabled` flag or `DD_PROFILING_ENABLED` environment variable is set to `true`. Update to your service invocation should look like:

    ```shell
    java -javaagent:dd-java-agent.jar -Ddd.profiling.enabled=true -jar <YOUR_SERVICE>.jar <YOUR_SERVICE_FLAGS>
    ```

5. After a minute or two, visualize your profiles on the [Datadog APM > Profiling page][1].

**NOTE** The following arguments and environment variables have been deprecated:

| Arguments                       | Environment variable        | Description                                      |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `-Ddd.profiling.api-key-file` | DD_PROFILING_API_KEY_FILE | Deprecated in version 0.55. File that should contain the API key as a string. See above for how to configure dd-trace-java.jar to upload profiles via the Datadog Agent instead. |
|                               | DD_PROFILING_API_KEY      | Datadog API key.                                  |
| `-Ddd.site`                   | DD_SITE                   | Deprecated in version 0.55. Destination site for your profiles (versions 0.48+). Valid options are `datadoghq.com` for Datadog US site (default), and `datadoghq.eu` for the Datadog EU site. See above for how to configure dd-trace-java.jar to upload profiles via the Datadog Agent instead. |
| `-Ddd.profiling.proxy.host`     | DD_PROFILING_PROXY_HOST     | Deprecated in version 0.55. Host for your proxy (`my-proxy.example.com`).    |
| `-Ddd.profiling.proxy.port`     | DD_PROFILING_PROXY_PORT     | Deprecated in version 0.55. Port used by your proxy. Default port is `8080`. |
| `-Ddd.profiling.proxy.username` | DD_PROFILING_PROXY_USERNAME | Deprecated in version 0.55. Username used by your proxy.                     |
| `-Ddd.profiling.proxy.password` | DD_PROFILING_PROXY_PASSWORD | Deprecated in version 0.55. Password used by your proxy.                     |

Perform following steps to migrate your service to send profiles directly through the agent:

1. Upgrade your agent to version [7.20.2][1]+ or [6.20.2][1]+

2. Upgrade the tracing library to [version 0.39][2]+ or run the following command to get the latest tracer version::

    ```shell
    pip install ddtrace
    ```

3. Clear `DD_PROFILING_API_KEY` or `DD_API_KEY` environment variable as they were deprecated in version 0.39:

    ```shell
    unset DD_PROFILING_API_KEY

    # OR

    unset DD_API_KEY
